Natural language processing makes it possible for computers
to understand the human language. In natural language
processing, human language is separated into fragments so that
the grammatical structure of sentences and the meaning of words
can be analysed and understood in context. This helps computers
read and understand spoken or written text in the same way as
humans. I am studying Natural Language Processing at Amrita
University.
